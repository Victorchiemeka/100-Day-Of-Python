Day 30 of my 100 Days of Python challenge. 

I worked on adding exception handling to my NATO Alphabet program and my password manager program. 

I also learned how to use JSON files and different JSON methods.

I I updated my password manager program by adding a ‘Find Password’ button that searches through the JSON file and retrieves the password and email for the user.”
