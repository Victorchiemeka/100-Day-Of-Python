Day 10 of 100 Days of Coding with Python
Today, I was introduced to functions with output (return values) and learned how to use Docstrings to describe the purpose of my functions. Additionally, I delved into the concept of using recursive functions in Python.

I applied my newfound knowledge to build a simple calculator based on what I had learned.

Furthermore, I dedicated time to working on some of my ALX tasks. I plan to wrap these tasks up tomorrow.
